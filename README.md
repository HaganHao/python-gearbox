Python library for design of spur and helical gears transmissions

###Install
the project is on *pypi* server for installation use:

*`pip install python-gearbox`*

for manual installation download the last release from:

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-gearbox

`python setup.py install`

make shure you have installed all dependencies `jinja2, numpy and scipy`

###Features
- Gear stresses calculation using AGMA-2101 D04 and ISO-6336 standards
- Optimization of the profile shift modification
- Export 2D and 3D one tooth geometrical models, to *MATLAB/COMSOL* for spur and helical gears
- Export 2D and 3D one tooth geometrical models, to *ABAQUS-CAE* only for spur gears
- Export 2D and 3D one tooth geometrical models, to *ANSYS* only for spur gears

###Next Releases
- Add the export capabilities for helical gears in ANSYS and ABAQUS-CAE softwares
